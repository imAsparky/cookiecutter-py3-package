Features
--------

#. Choose to use a `Conventional-Commits`_ specification custom commits message
   in your built package.
#. An optional GitHub action to automatically update semantic version and
   publish assets to your package repository when a pull request merge is
   closed or manually.
#. Manual semantic versioning and publishing are also available locally,
   bypassing the need for a GitHub action if that is your preferred workflow.
#. An optional GitHub action to generate a package CHANGELOG automatically if
   you choose to version and publish your package manually.
#. An optional GitHub action to run your `Tox`_ package test suite when a
   pull request to the main branch starts.
#. Optional to use to use `pre-commit`_ to identuify simple coding issues
   before submission, with a badge to communicate quickly.
#. `Tox`_ configuration for your package includes an OS and Python test matrix.
   OS includes Linux, macOS and Windows. Python 3.6 - 3.9. (Uses GitHub actions.)
#. An optional suite of custom GitHub issue templates. The four custom issue
   templates prompt users to help provide enough information in a templated
   format for each issue type.
#. Documentation is in the process of being refreshed and organised into the
   `Diataxis`_ documentation framework.
#. `Sphinx`_ docs: Documentation ready for generation with, for example, `Read the Docs`_.
#. Optional to use to use a `Read the Docs`_ badge to communicate quickly.
#. Auto-release to `PyPI`_ when you push a new tag to main (optional). Coming soon.
#. Use commit tags to release to `Test-PyPi`_. Coming soon.
#. An optional Command line interface using Click or Argparse.
#. An option to initialise your local git repository, add files and create the
   first commit automatically. Also if you have opted to use the
   `Conventional-Commits`_ style git commit message template, cookiecutter
   will simultaneously add it to your local git config file.
#. Optional to use to use a `Repo Status`_ badge to communicate quickly.


.. note::

   Initialise your local git requires Git v2.33.0 or above.

Not Exactly What You Want?
--------------------------

Don't worry, you have options:

Similar Cookiecutter Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `ardydedase/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork with separate requirements
   files rather than a requirements list in the ``setup.py`` file.

* `briggySmalls/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork using Poetry_ for neat package
   management and deployment, with linting, formatting, no makefiles and more.

* `zillionare/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A template containing Poetry_, Mkdocs_,
   Github CI and many more. It's a template and a package also
   (can be installed with `pip`)

* Also see the `network`_ and `family tree`_ for the original repo. (If you
  find anything that should be listed here, please add it and send a
  pull request!)

Fork This / Create Your Own
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this
to create your own version. Or create your own; it doesn't strictly have to
be a fork.

* Once you have your own version working, add it to the Similar Cookiecutter
  Templates list above with a brief description.

* It's up to you whether or not to rename your fork/own version. Do whatever
  you think sounds good.

Or Submit a Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I also accept pull requests on this, if they're small, atomic, and if they
make my own packaging experience better.
